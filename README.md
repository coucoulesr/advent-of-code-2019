## About Advent of Code
<p>Hi!  I'm <a href="http://was.tl/">Eric Wastl</a>. I make Advent of Code.  I hope you like it!  I also made <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">Vanilla JS</a>, <a href="http://phpsadness.com/">PHP Sadness</a>, and <a href="http://was.tl/projects/">lots of other things</a>.  You can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/ericwastl">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://github.com/topaz">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p><em>Advent of Code</em> is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in <a href="https://github.com/search?q=advent+of+code">any</a> programming language you like. People use them as a <a href="/leaderboard">speed contest</a>, <a href="https://y3l2n.com/2018/05/09/interview-prep-advent-of-code/">interview</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/dznqbit/status/1037607793144938497">prep</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/pgoultiaev/status/950805811583963137">company training</a>, <a href="https://gitlab.com/imhoffman/fa19b4-mat3006/wikis/home">university</a> <a href="https://www.gribblelab.org/scicomp2018/">coursework</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mrdanielklein/status/936267621468483584">practice</a> <a href="https://comp215.blogs.rice.edu/">problems</a>, or to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/search?q=flair%3Aupping&restrict_sr=on">challenge each other</a>.</p>
<p>You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/7kd8jt/what_would_you_say_are_the_minimal_skills_for/dre0uu3/">problem solving skills</a> will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.</p>
